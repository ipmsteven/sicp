;; Normal-order evaluation is the "fully expand and then reduce" option.
;; Under normal-order evaluation, (test 0 (p)) is fully expanded as
;;
;; (test 0 (p)) ==
;; (if (= 0 0)
;;  0
;;  (p))
;; Since `if` has the semantics described in the question, and the test condition in the expansion is (= 0 0),
;; which is true, the normal-order evaluator determines to evaluate the consequent, which is 0, so the value of the expression is 0.

;; Using the applicative-order evaluation however, the first step in evaluating (test 0 (p)) is to evaluate the expressions test, 0, and (p),
;; and then call ("apply", hence "applicative") the value of test with the values produced by evaluating 0 and (p).
;; Since the evaluation of (p) will not complete, neither will the evaluation of (test 0 (p)).
